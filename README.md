============

I am a full-stack software developer with nearly 20 years of experience creating websites and applications in numerous technologies. I've been a software developer since the late '90s.  The day my family got access to the internet I learned how to "program HTML" and never looked back.  My career started when myself and a few high school friends launched a web development company targeting local small businesses.  Over the next 2 decades I have tasted the waters of various development experiences ranging from Javascript, .Net, C++, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go and countless frameworks and libraries.  These days I finally consider myself a Senior engineer only because I finally recognize how little I know.  The last few years have found me leading a team of young developers working on a monolithic application.  I have daily challenges finding ways to make myself and my team members grow as developers and people.

I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my career.

## Projects
* This website - [View it on GitHub](https://github.com/jamespwright/jamespwright.com)
* "Wizard Battle Arena" (_private repository_) - a Unity game I'm designing as a way to expand outside of "business" development

## To Learn
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) - I have been wanting to add a functional language to my toolset for a while.  I previously had done a little playing around with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) but Elixir has a robust web framework in [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) as well as a larger local community.  
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - Growing in popularity for use as an API layer that does a good job of stitching together data from micro-services.
* [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) - Blazor uses C# and WebAssembly to allow for the creation of websites written entirely in C# and HTML.  I have done the basic "To Do" app in Blazor and look forward to it growing further to become more production-ready.

## Hobbies
* Software Developer
* Soccer enthusiast
